                    <h4>Fulltime jobs</h4>
                    <p>I worked mainly with backend (thou I thouched early React and Angular 4 at some point), 5 years with C#, 2 years and counting with Elixir. Along the way I wrote integration systems, backends for web interfaces, rewrote a legacy project or two (that's surprisingly fun!). Now I'm also running my own team, building a project I'm responsible of.</p>
                    <h4>Freelance</h4>
                    <p>I did a frontend for a recycling kiosk. You can put waste there and get points to exchange for points to use across the city. I did it using Elm 0.13 and it's still running in production without hiccups. CSS was a big pain thou.</p>
                    <h4>yet unnamed tower defense (wip)</h4>
                    <p>Big work in progress, just at the start of the project. I'm using GameMakerStudio 2 to build a 2D Tower Defence game. More as it develops.
                    <h4>contract brigde (wip)</h4>
                    <p>I kinda forgot about this project and recently recalled I did that. There's some code (Elixir + Phoenix LiveView) but I need to rewrite a lot of stuff after some thinking. When I'm done with above project I will resurrect this and link to the repo</p>

                    <h2>Music projects</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <h4>Drumming</h4>
                    <p>I currently play drums with a local band: Lucha Beaver. We're working on EP which I'm slowly mixing.</p>
                    <p>I composed and recorded drums for <a href="https://album.link/pl/i/1570284078"> a prog rock album</a>. </p>
                    <h4>Music production</h4>
                    <p>There is some stuff at <a href="https://soundcloud.com/dreat_nihil">on my soundcloud page</a> - a bit of dark ambient + some music challenges.</p>
                    <p> In May 2022 I performed debut MonoChromancer ambient concert in front of 600 people at <a href="https://festiwalswiatla.hs3.pl">Festival of Light</a></p>
                    <p> In May 2023 I performed as MonoChromancer again at FoL in Gdańsk. This time I also <a href="https://album.link/s/2YVFDSW2w99MUYaijNaytQ">released a debut album</a></p>
                    <h4>SonicPi workshops</h4>
                    <p>I did a SonicPi workshops for IKM Gdańsk and Starter. This was aimed for total beginners to start making music with code.</p>
                    <h4>Music for Metabow (wip)</h4>
                    <p>I'm making music for <a href="https://aerloth.itch.io/metabow">Metabow, a VR Game</a>. There's already a build with some music by me, there's a need for some battle music as well.</p>
                    <h4>Gamejam music</h4>
                    <p>I made a music for a <a href="https://satolas.itch.io/spacelinks">Spacelinks</a>, game made for GMTK Gamejam 2021. I had 48hrs to work on this. While our idea for final piece was much more ambitious (and music was made), folks who made the game didn't have time to properly implement complex layering system. What's in the game is cool as well, it's just the idea that sparked during last 8 hours of work. I'm really glad how it went. Definitely will work with guys in the future, it was a blast.</p>
                    <h4>Music for astrophotography themed YouTube channel)</h4>
                    <p>Intro music + music in background for talking. <a href="https://youtu.be/4XapHq_uKG4">(link)</a></p>
